# Emacs configuration for Scala development

This is not my original work.  It is a copy of Robert Krahnâ€™s [Emacs configuration for Rust](https://github.com/rksm/emacs-rust-config),
but with the Rust specific part replaced with the example configuration given in
[the official Metals Emacs instructions](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/emacs/#installation).

I have added a couple small configuration settings to my personal preferences, such as:

- Displaying line numbers
- Disabling tabs in favor of spaces
- Auto-reloading buffers when files are changed outside Emacs
- Running `scalafmt` automatically when saving a buffer

and probably others.  See the original sources for usage details.  Use at your own risk and pleasure.
